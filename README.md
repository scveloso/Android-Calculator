# Task
Using good coding practice and techniques, implement the functions of the simple calculator. 
The manditory functions are the +,-,x and / while the other ones are optional and for you to
show off your mad skills (e.g. trig functions, hex calculator, exp functions, etc.).

# Your comments or assumptions
- Changed onClickListeners to anonymous classes (It's what I'm used to, hope it's okay). 
- Added a button that retrieves current temperature in Houston, Texas (The other Android pre-task).
